# Database Connection Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The database connection was failing due to missing Electron dependency and SQLite3 compatibility issues.

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. ✅ Missing Electron Dependency
- **Problem**: Electron was referenced in package.json but not installed
- **Solution**: Added Electron as devDependency
```bash
npm install electron --save-dev
```

### 2. ✅ SQLite3 - Electron Compatibility
- **Problem**: SQLite3 module was compiled for Node.js, not Electron
- **Solution**: Rebuilt SQLite3 for Electron's Node.js version
```bash
npx electron-rebuild -f -w sqlite3
```

### 3. ✅ Added .gitignore
- **Problem**: node_modules was being committed (193MB+ files)
- **Solution**: Added comprehensive .gitignore to exclude:
  - node_modules/
  - Build artifacts
  - IDE files
  - OS files
  - Logs and temporary files

## Verification Results
- ✅ Database connection working: "SQLite veritabanına bağlanıldı"
- ✅ All tables present: stok, satisGecmisi, musteriler, borclarim
- ✅ Server starts successfully on port 3000
- ✅ API endpoints responding correctly
- ✅ No more git push errors

## Commands to Start Application
```bash
# Start server only
npm run api

# Start Electron app
npm start

# Start in hybrid mode
npm run hibrit
```

## Future Maintenance
- Dependencies properly managed with package.json
- No large files in git repository
- Clean development workflow established
